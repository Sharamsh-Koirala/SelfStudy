# The Manifesto

A beautiful metaphor which summarizes this repository is an anecdote about legendary cellist Pablo Casals. At the age of 80 he was the subject of a movie, A Day in the Life of Pablo Casals and the movie’s director Robert Snyder asked Casals why he continued to practice four-five hours a day. Casals answered “Because I think I am making progress”. This is the spirit in which I undertook this work, not as an efficient way of going about learning but a lifelong desire to appreciate the journey of someday achieving mastery. I believe I made some progress.

The lectures are old, going back to the 1970’s but unparalleled in its insight to the plethora of mathematical and computing courses available today. I wish they were my mentors with whom I could have spent years under their apprenticeship, could have known them personally. Mentors who could have helped me when I could not (didn’t want to) keep up with the drudgery of the school curriculum. However, I am grateful to the everyone who helped made these courses into recorded lectures and the opportunity I got to spend time with the professors, whatever the format may be. I am thankful for their presence in my life.
  
The making of these annotated notes was an exercise to revolt against the conditioning of having gone through the school system. These were more of a scouting an unchartered territory at a higher level than in-depth research. Not to pass some test and throw away the information next moment, similar to what happened in previous academic pedagogical programs, but rather to retain a vital source of knowledge for decades to come. This relates to the idea of “Cathedral Thinking” and an apt quote follows:
> He who has seen one cathedral ten times has seen something; he who has seen ten cathedrals once has seen but little; and he who has spent half an hour in each of a hundred cathedrals has seen nothing at all.
>>>>> -Sinclair Lewis
<br>
This was a practice aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of the material, from a time of miniscule understanding to now having the self-trust and the patience of having gone through this undergraduate material, at my own pace and with professors for whom I have very high regards for. I enjoyed every minute of going through these lectures. At times this was a meditative exercise, others a self-induced torment (thankfully a seldom occurrence). Professors, who spent years honing their skills and now had the freedom, the medium to speak their minds uninterrupted was a delightful learning experience.

## On Mathematics education  

Professor Herbert Gross emphasises a subtle but important point in one of his [TEDx Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orqfXaDqm7Y), “It’s the delivery system, it’s how we teach people, it’s how we relate to them, it’s not how well the subject is produced on video”. It pertains to the idea of why his 5 decades old mathematics lectures are still viewed online and still have a cult-like following. In the TED talk he highlights “functional innumeracy”, people who can compute but don’t know how or when to do it. He talks about OCR equation solver that can solve complex problems but can’t tell where that equation came from and under what conditions it’s valid to use it, which should be the part students should be taught. To Prof. Herbert all the modern technological devices are a wonderful delivery system but without putting in the right information its practically useless. He gives a comical anecdote of delivering stale doughnuts in a Rolls Royce which doesn’t make the doughnuts any fresher. Modern education system improving on the Rolls Royce but neglecting the content and the need of its intended recipients. He paraphrases the NRA, calculators don’t make mistakes, the people who punch the numbers that do.

Prof. Herbert during his time at MIT mentions how teaching the top 2% of the students and subsequently the syllabus was adopted by academic institutions across the world had a dissonance. People who have never really experienced the problem were designing educational curriculum for the average student. He points to the “No Child Left Behind” Act of 2001 passed in the USA but declares the sad fact that children will always be left behind, from the time of kindergarten where some children are already familiar with numbers and alphabets from being put into pre-school while others are not. The gap never really closes in a way.

A coping mechanism that I personally resorted to when faced with the mathematics curriculum was, “Why do I have to know this? Where am I ever going to use it?”. It was the feeling of, If I couldn’t be good at something let me at least believe that what I was bad at wasn’t worth knowing in the first place. Prof. Herbert points to Khan Academy, which is wonderful for kids who want to know how to solve a problem but doesn’t do a thing to the kid who says why does he have to know this, and that is what teachers are not doing enough in mathematical education today.	

Another personal source of inspiration was the short book, [*A Mathematician's Lament*](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf) by Paul Lockhart. An excerpt from the book reads:
> The main problem with school mathematics is that there are no problems. Oh, I know what passes for problems in math classes, these insipid “exercises.” “Here is a type of problem. Here is how to solve it. Yes, it will be on the test. Do exercises 1-35 odd for homework.” What a sad way to learn mathematics: to be a trained chimpanzee.

<br>
<br> 
SIMPLICIO: Did you practice what you learnt? Did you apply it in any of your projects?   
<br><br>
SALVIATI: I used the Calculus I, II and III book by the Jerrold E. Marsden and Alan Weinstein from California Institute of Technology along with the lectures from Prof. Herbert Gross. It has a large number of exercises and paired nicely with the lectures, although some topics came up early in the lecture than the book and vice versa but its manageable. For Statistics and Probability, I used the videos from The Organic Chemistry Tutor in YouTube. He went through a good number of problems and along with that I used the book “All of Statistics” by Larry Wasserman for further study. I didn’t complete it from cover to cover but it remains as a good anchoring point. It also has computer experiment exercises which are to be programmatically implemented and I plan to complete it in the coming years. Linear algebra was covered to an extent in the Calculus courses and I will study it further as requirement arises in the future. For Algorithms, I am now currently participating in CodeWars and as the difficulty increases, I am bound to run into relevant topics from the subject and apply it when necessary. This is a preparatory structure for when a suitable project arises and I am able to combine and use this knowledge skilfully. I hope.  
<br>
<br><br><br>
SIMPLICIO: Did you not learn anything in your undergraduate program? Why go through this trouble?  
<br> <br>
SALVIATI: I did learn a lot but if a bachelor’s program is the be-all and end-all of academia we wouldn’t have higher levels of education. During my undergraduate I had a goal of passing my exams and put in only adequate amount of effort to reach that goal.  
<br>  
    Comparing the engineering education of Nepal in contrast to that of western standards are two very different modes of learning. In the Nepali curriculum there are about 6-8 subjects every semester i.e., every 6 months you’re supposed to go through 6-8 books and its accompanying materials, add to that student club’s projects and then live your life. It doesn’t reflect how life plays out after graduation. During postgraduate and doctorate degree where you’re supposed to specialize in one specific field and in a specific topic, it further doesn’t make sense why you’d have to cram through all that information. In the end, most students end up memorizing notes and past questions just to get through the exams never really appreciating the history and developmental stages that the field had to go through. A façade of an education, a disservice to the meaning of what a “school” should be. To the Greeks school meant “leisure”, leisure allowed a man to spend time thinking and finding out about things, the connection between leisure and the pursuit of knowledge and eventually to a place of learning. So far away are we from those roots, it seems nonsensical to even mention this in our hyper-competitive world.  
<br>
    The college I went to had partnered with a British University and we went through a different system of education altogether. It was a more hands on approach where the students were taught about different tools of the trade, as in different programming languages and frameworks. Then we were given assignments along with projects to complete and research on our own most of what was necessary, or if it piqued our interest. It was definitely a better approach to learning but lacked some core elements of the theoretical side of academia. This self-study was to compensate for that.
<br>
<br>
<br><br>
SIMPLICIO: Was this a mindless jotting down of notes or did you learn anything?  
<br><br>  
SALVIATI: The honest answer is yes to both. I paid attention to the best of my ability yet it was a tiring process and there were lapses into daydreaming. Nonetheless, I wanted to make something beautiful and enjoy the process of delving into something for hours on end. I felt like I was learning a new language where you really don’t expect to understand everything all at once but with years of repetitions gain a solid mastery.
<br>
<br><br><br>
SIMPLICIO: Isn’t is hypocritical that you criticize the current education system but then go through the exact material taught in university courses?  
<br><br>
SALVIATI: In a sense it might be but as I have mentioned before and Prof. Herbert Gross so beautifully explains in his TEDx talk, it was to answer the fundamental question of why, why do we need this in the first place anyway? Going through the exercises as a way to solve different types of problems without knowing the history behind its development, why it was developed, understanding the mentality of their creators / discoverers was my main goal. To get into the mindset of these master in their field. I did cram this information to pass a test, but never really gave time to understand the nuances. All of this was self-paced, repeating parts of the lectures which I found fascinating then using them to practice the exercises to solidify my comprehension. Besides, these were “The Cream of the crop” so to speak. Among thousands and thousands of online courses and MOOCs, I found these lecturers to really understand the problem I was facing, millions of other students were facing and addressed them. Going through the exercises then felt meaningful and I had insight into the rich history and the amazing people behind it. The endurance and the character of these pioneers to have the patience and dedication to develop something new even in the face of ridicule and scorn.
<br>
<br><br><br>
SIMPLICIO: These notes you’ve made isn’t really helpful to anyone but yourself? What’s the point of making this repository public?  
<br><br>
SALVIATI: I will be glad if this repository helps one person who was lost as I was during my time at the school and university. This repo contains something that lacks in many online courses, specifically teachers who understand how to approach education in a fulfilling way. They give time to go into the lives of scholars that made the subject what it is today, they have a sense of humour about failing and it being a natural part of life. They justify the years spent on topics which may not have immediate value to society at large. I found it invaluable and that is more than enough for me, if one other person finds this helpful it’ll be more than I ever hoped for.
<br>
<br><br><br>
SIMPLICIO: Why use “seasons” to describe the different units that are in the lectures? The use of various colours as well? Seems very childish.   
<br><br>
SALVIATI: I am a big fan of binging on movies and television/ web series. The flow of a story on how characters are slowly built up, the climaxes, the subtle nuances that goes into world building and the lore behind the story line is why many people are drawn into it. It helps us to relate to characters that go through a similar set of circumstances that we may been going through in our own lives. The gradual development of ideas into larger ones that form a complex structure of the subject of mathematics and computer science today mimics the stories I was most familiar with. Hence the differentiation parts of lectures into “season”. I hope I made some sense.
I was unable to find the exact quote but Carl Gustav Jung, the famous psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, which says something along the lines of, a little boy’s play is the most honest enterprise. I wanted this to be a child-like play of colours and ideas, never wanting the work put into it be as mundane and ashen like those did in school days. It was a celebration so to speak, filled with colours and joy in having done something just for its sake and nothing else. Besides, the colours helped differentiate various idea, using only a single-coloured pen would have made it practically unreadable.

## Closure

A philosophical closure brings up the question, when confronted with the reality that nothing was holding you back, where do you go? Maybe it was the feeling of lack, the feeling of not being enough, of not having enough. Now, with no one to blame, not even yourself, what do you do? Seeing yourself struggle, struggle to find the words to explain, struggle to move on, struggle, struggle. Maybe that’s not it. One should imagine Sisyphus happy as Albert Camus puts it, maybe it’s just that I imagine this work to be so.
